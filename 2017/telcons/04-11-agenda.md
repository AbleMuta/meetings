### EME and copyright (Notes from Marcos, as requested by DKA)
EME is a legal instrument, in the guise of a technological standard, for content to fall under the purview of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (or similar draconian laws depending on jurisdiction).

Citing from, [The Public Domain](http://www.thepublicdomain.org/download/) (my emphasis):

> The Digital Millennium Copyright Act gives content providers a whole array of legally protected digital fences to enclose
their work. **In some cases it effectively removes the privilege of fair use**.
Each day brings some new Internet horror story about the excesses of intellectual
property.

To be sure, EME destroys the ability for academics, journalists, and the general public to access the "protected media" under fair use (in the US). This is because to get at the content one must circumvent EME (whose penalties for circumvention are severe). It's also abused by corporations to stifle innovation and culture: remixing, satire, and even certain forms of new reporting all become illegal ([The Public Domain](http://www.thepublicdomain.org/download/)). 

Also outlined in the Electronic Frontiers Foundation, “[Unintended Consequences](https://www.eff.org/files/2014/09/16/unintendedconsequences2014.pdf)”:

* The DMCA Chills Free Expression and Scientific Research.
* The DMCA Jeopardizes Fair Use.
* The DMCA Impedes Competition and Innovation.
* The DMCA Interferes with Computer Intrusion Laws.

> "the anti-circumvention provisions have been used to stifle a wide array of legitimate activities. As a result, the DMCA has become a serious threat to several important public policy priorities"

Further, EME provides little to no protection to those that lacks significant financial and legal resources (i.e., small content producers), while disproportionally benefiting the ability of monopolistic powers to curtail free speech and innovation (see, for example, Sony's continuous abuses of such laws - as outlined in "[Unintended Consequences](https://www.eff.org/files/2014/09/16/unintendedconsequences2014.pdf)" ).
