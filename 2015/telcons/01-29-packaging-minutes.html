    <p class='irc'>&lt;<cite>plinss</cite>&gt; trackbot, prepare
    telcon</p>

    <p class='irc'>&lt;<cite>trackbot</cite>&gt; Date: 29 January
    2015</p>

    <p class='phone'><cite>Yves:</cite> hasn’t been that much
    discussion on the webapps list -</p>

    <p class='phone'>… we discuss the use case.</p>

    <p class='phone'>…and if the use case is just performance or
    something else.</p>

    <p class='phone'>… if it’s just performance than tthere are
    other ideas - e.g. manifest - that have surfaced on the mailing
    list. So in that case do we really need a packaging format or
    is http/2 enough.</p>

    <p class='phone'>… we should ask Anne what his thinking is -
    since it started with a request from mozilla to address content
    in apackage.</p>

    <p class='phone'>… was it linked to mobile or a general web use
    case?</p>

    <p class='phone'><cite>Peter:</cite> another use case -
    ebooks.</p>

    <p class='phone'><cite>Yves:</cite> another discussion -
    sending package - serialization of a library...</p>

    <p class='phone'><cite>Mark:</cite> that’s an archive
    format.</p>

    <p class='phone'><cite>Dan:</cite> I remeber support foor this
    from Yehuda, Dave…</p>

    <p class='phone'><cite>Yves:</cite> yes for javascript
    libraries - internal dependencies…</p>

    <p class='phone'>… also don’t need to serialize all requests to
    the wire...</p>

    <p class='phone'>… and links to an issue raised on the
    packaging spec re: service worker.</p>

    <p class='phone'><cite>mark:</cite> not seralizing all requests
    to the wire seems like a performance concern.</p>

    <p class='phone'>… last discussion on ml seems to call for
    working through the use cases more carefully. There are some
    use cases that may or not may not make sense. I find the idea
    of a package for a js library or an ebook - reasonably
    intriguing.</p>

    <p class='phone'>… but the stretch is –&nbsp;not necessarilly a
    good performance technique.</p>

    <p class='phone'>… moving the web towards single page flash app
    kind of experience.</p>

    <p class='phone'><cite>Dan:</cite> is it reasonable to say that
    we need to look to non-performance use cases? since people are
    looking to http/2 for performance...</p>

    <p class='phone'><cite>Yves:</cite> I think looking only to
    http2 for certain cases - lots of files - I think a package is
    a good option...</p>

    <p class='phone'><cite>Mark:</cite> it’s not onerous to have
    multiple requests with http/2 – the mantra of reducing number
    of requests changes with http/2</p>

    <p class='phone'><cite>Yan:</cite> I had a non-performance use
    case - which I opened up as a github issue...</p>

    <p class='phone'>… my use case was for package signing - having
    one file with a well defined signature seems really useful to
    me.</p>

    <p class='phone'>+1</p>

    <p class='phone'><cite>Yves:</cite> the conclusion is that we
    need to continue working on the use case.</p>

    <p class='phone'>… which was the conclusion of the email thread
    as well.</p>

    <p class='phone'><cite>Dan:</cite> What about the logistics of
    how we work on this...</p>

    <p class='phone'>… what is Marcos’s role?</p>

    <p class='phone'><cite>Yves:</cite> Marcos is working on the
    manfiest file [and we want to avoid conflicts]<br />
    ... I can step in as editor [for now]</p>

    <p class='phone'><cite>Dan:</cite> we drive the discussion on
    the use case on Github -</p>

    <p class='phone'>… really need to reach back out to Anne,
    Wycats, Dave, .. also Marcos, also Jonas from Mozilla.. Any
    others?</p>

    <p class='irc'>&lt;<cite>wycats____</cite>&gt; sounds good
    :)</p>

    <p class='phone'>… Maybe alex can comment on the chrome side…
    Likewise Travis from a MS perspective.</p>

    <p class='phone'>yay!</p>

    <p class='phone'>wycats do you have any quick words of support
    for the ongoing work on packaging?</p>

    <p class='irc'>&lt;<cite>wycats</cite>&gt; dka: I continue to
    disagree that HTTP/2 solves the issues</p>

    <p class='irc'>&lt;<cite>wycats</cite>&gt; for all of the
    reasons we've discussed</p>

    <p class='phone'>ok thanks for that -</p>

    <p class='irc'>&lt;<cite>wycats</cite>&gt; count me among the
    supporters!</p>

    <p class='phone'>Would be good to get your feedback and
    continued support in the github discussion.</p>

    <p class='phone'>awesome.</p>

    <p class='irc'>&lt;<cite>wycats</cite>&gt; +1</p>

    <p class='phone'>thx!</p>

    <p class='phone'><cite>Peter:</cite> when we initially
    discussed - talking about the use cases - idea of installing it
    on yourserver and also uninflate it on your server - so
    browsers that aren’t aware of the format could make individual
    requests… you don’t necesarilly have to pull the whole package
    down. Not necesarilly forcing people to retreive the whole
    package every single time.</p>

    <p class='phone'><cite>Mark:</cite> I agree that that’s a
    reasonable case - as far as I can tell we havem’t had interest
    in server side folks in doing that.</p>

    <p class='phone'>… makes me question if we have the right
    people involved…</p>

    <p class='phone'>… also that could be supported by service
    worker…</p>

    <p class='phone'><cite>Peter:</cite> a polyfil in serviceworker
    could be equivelent.</p>

    <p class='phone'>… on the ebook side, the resources might not
    be delivered over the web.</p>

    <p class='phone'>[discussion on the definition of the web]</p>

    <p class='phone'>[and multi-part mime]</p>

    <h3 id="item01">Spec Reviews &amp; Future Calls</h3>

    <p class='phone'><cite>Peter:</cite> Houdini session in 3
    weeks…</p>

    <p class='irc'>&lt;<cite>wycats</cite>&gt; I'm not on the call,
    but we have been over and over the "HTTP/2 solves everything"
    argument</p>

    <p class='irc'>&lt;<cite>wycats</cite>&gt; one rationale is
    just having a standardized way to package up a bunch of assets
    (the Ember library as modules for example) with HTTP
    metadata</p>

    <p class='irc'>&lt;<cite>mnot</cite>&gt; wycats, no one is
    saying that "HTTP/2 solves everything." They quesiton is
    whether the motivating use cases for this are really
    performance, or something else.</p>

    <p class='irc'>&lt;<cite>wycats</cite>&gt; mnot: aha!</p>

    <p class='irc'>&lt;<cite>wycats</cite>&gt; in the fullness of
    time, it's likely that the motivating use-case is a way to
    package up the HTTP metadata in a way that a smart HTTP server
    can use to distribute the assets as efficiently as it can</p>

    <p class='irc'>&lt;<cite>wycats</cite>&gt; in the short-run it
    has other benefits</p>

    <p class='irc'>&lt;<cite>wycats</cite>&gt; (I mean a smart
    HTTP/2 server here)</p>

    <p class='irc'>&lt;<cite>wycats</cite>&gt; ha</p>

    <p class='phone'>thanks yehuda</p>

    <p class='irc'>&lt;<cite>wycats</cite>&gt; dka: np</p>

    <p class='irc'>&lt;<cite>wycats</cite>&gt; thanks for
    pinging</p>

    <p class='irc'>&lt;<cite>mnot</cite>&gt; wycats: yes, I'm very
    interested in that. Would love to get server-side folks
    involved</p>

    <p class='irc'>&lt;<cite>wycats</cite>&gt; mnot: agreed</p>

    <p class='irc'>&lt;<cite>wycats</cite>&gt; Service Worker is a
    plausible vector for prototyping too</p>

    <p class='irc'>&lt;<cite>mnot</cite>&gt; wycats: +1</p>

    <p class='phone'>[discussion of mailing list use / moderation /
    etc...]</p>

    <p class='phone'><cite>Dan:</cite> I can start the thing in a
    gist however it’s pronounced...</p>

    <p class='irc'>&lt;<cite>wycats</cite>&gt; I have heard people
    pronounce github as "jit-hub"</p>
