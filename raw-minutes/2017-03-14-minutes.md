Progressive Webapps - punt to next call?

Media Session (149):
    Comments left in github issue
    No further comments on travis's comments
    David: it's the thing related to media metadata ... 
    ... [feedbaclk] seems fine with me.
    Peter: let's go ahead and file these as issues in their repo and revisit.
    
Custom Paint (140):
	David: I went through the feedback we sent already - I left a comment in the issue - not sure what e
	Peter: My guess is it won't get addressed before their next f2f - let's reschedule toc ome back at our f2f
	
Remote Playback (145):
    Sangwhan: seems to be an extension of what platforms already provide.... one thing I am concerned about is lack of implementation detail... underlying implementation is up to the UA (Mirrorcast, Airplay, etc...)
    ... and due to that I'm sure how well this would work in practice ...
    ... would depend on the implementation ...
    ... might lead to sitation where content developers say e.g. "you must use chrome and android tv"
    ... risk of fragmentation.
    ... that is my only concern from what I've reviewed.
    ... Tight coupling between the browser and the protocol - means lack of interop.
    ... the APIs look sane but lack of protocol is problematic.
	Dan: some things like EME do couple the browser to a technology
	Sanwhan: EME is cross-platform at least. Mirrorcast, chromecast, Airplay, DLNA.... 
	... from a W3C perspective, the lack of definition of transport would be a problem.
	... I can go chat with the group and see what their thinking is related to this issue.
	Peter: where does this fit with Second Screen?
	Sangwhan: Same people...
	... this is independent - this is an extension to the HTML media element ... (It is from the same group though)
	Travis: wonders if there shouldn't be some way of specifying the underlying protocols, which are generally interoperable, no? E.g., thinking about how <img> and other "containers" work with multiple underlying protocols. That infrastructure seems to require MIME type advertising, etc. All of that seems to be missing in this spec.
	
Tim's Anti-Fake-News
  from https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/mar/11/tim-berners-lee-web-inventor-save-internet
	Hadley: We don't have a mechanism in thw web to mark something as "Authoritative" or "credible" - we often use page rank (and equivalents at FB, Twitter, etc.) as a proxy for that.
	... so popular (but fake) things can spread ...
	... we could call for research ...
	... web annotations may well be a part of it ...
	... it's a way of attaching a "yes I trust this" or "no don't trust" to an article. We don't have the way to figure out whether you should or shouldn't trust...
	... or in a censorship kind of way.
	... so that's a piece of the puzzle.
	... there are 2 other areas in Tim's letter - one is politcal advertising and targetting - don't know if there is much we can do there. Based on content users post about themselves and their trackable behaviour on social media sites... Less of a standards problem.
	... the other area he's talking about is personal data and misuse of personal data. Terms & Conditions give power to service and not to the user...
	... one thing we could do there - flag up to policy makers what user data is exposed.
	... say "given the web platform as it is, this is the info that will be accesible about an individual by services ... it may be appropriate for govts. to take action.
	... Ts&Cs is thorny issue - fundamental imbalance of power inherent in running a service that can see the behaviour of many users, whereas the users can only see their own data. - 
	... feel like this is an area that needs more discussion & research
	David: it feels like some of what sites know about users - hard to know how much a site knows - depends on how much they push the boundary of fingerprinting
	... not sure there's a clear thing to explaining to polcymakers about what is possible - answer could be that sites that sites can do a lot to share data if they can figure out which users are the same...
	Hadley: that could end up being taken up in anti-trust and anti-competition law....
	Travis: there's also the question of amplification of signals... any one can post fake news and depending on how sensational it is, this could lead to its amplification, regardless of authenticity...
	Peter: bots and impact on recent election cycles - tools designed to manipulate large populations - psyops tools - is there something we can do to change the web works so this info is harder to gather?
	... e.g. changing cookie behaviour. Changing what could bedone cross-origin. Might mess up business models (break the web). But maybe we do need to break the web [to save it].
	Hadley: +1. That's where our power is. Legislations are largely trying to catch up with what we've built (as the web community). (Though I'm not yet sure what we'd want to break... but I think it's a useful discussion for us all to have.)
	Travis: Server correlation is definitely much harder for us to fix... 
	David: one example of that was trying to double-key cookies and it turns out there was one really big legit use - use of sign-in via some account - 
	... which we didn't want to mess up.  Probably some others too...
	Travis: Like Web Authentication!!! [+1]
	Hadley: would like to hear Alex's run-down on the AMP conference - great tweet from Jeremy Keith that most of the discussion was about how to track users and gather info and from his perspective that's not a feature that's a bug.
	Travis: Turning off cookie support in your browser is online suicide, but is about what would need to be done (technically) I think (outside of authenticated scenarios).
	Dan: comes down to tracking blockers and ad blockers.  Rise in installation of ad blockers.  Some is not wanting to see ads, but a bunch is about users wanting to protect their privacy.  So users installing ad blockers, or installing Brave.  This is a part of a fundamental imbalance.  If the answer to Peter's question is that everybody needs to install tracking blockers... that's not really going to solve the problem.  Problem needs to be fixed at the root.
	[Evil mastermind Dan, in favor of breaking the world to "fix" it :)] 
	Dan: I'll take these comments to Tim and then let's ask Tim what else. Maybe a session at our next F2F?
	
Upcoming Face-to-face
     Dan: should we have a developer meetup?
     Dan: could just have a panel.  But last time advised that i we wanted to engage with developers in Tokyo, best to do a tleast some in Japanese.
     Dan: Need to figure out what we want to achieve.
     Sangwhan: Venue often tricking -- office spaces that are open in the evening.  I'll message a couple of people, and can hopefully get back to you the next call.
     Dan: Let me and Alex know on the Slack.  And can see if Alex can get a space at the Google office.h

Yves: we received a bunch of new requests from the Web Platform Working Group
Travis: Yep, I can do it [Web Payments] (with David). Should probably do this next week, given the requested timeline?

#154 (spec reviews): Allow top-level navigation. Hmm. March 2nd? Already past....
Allowing iframes to navigate their top-level parent.
Dan: What problem is this solving?
Hadley: Blocks malicious auto-redirect from 3rd party... 
David: Maybe something in an Ad?
Travis: Why do we need the flag for it--should just be default behavior...
