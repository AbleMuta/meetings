Topic: spec reviews

https://github.com/w3ctag/spec-reviews/issues/42
Travis: we hit this yesterday morning when we had Mike West on the line
Travis: Is there going to be another monolithic addition of CSP, or is it going to be easier to add things ad-hoc?  i.e., is the CSP3 plan to create a massive document and publish it?  I hear there are lots of things that ould love to be added and don't want to wait for the big cycle.
mnot: I've heard that feedback from a lot of people too.  Maybe we should sit down with them at TPAC and try to work something out?
mnot: Some vendors have said they're not going to implement CSP2 or CSP3 yet.  If it's more fine-grained and you don't have to do them all at the same time, I think we need a different release model / different semantics for ... ?
Travis: push a couple of weeks out?
mnot: Do it as a TPAC milestone?
dka: Mark, can you add that to the issue so we remember to tee up that discussion at TPAC?

https://github.com/w3ctag/spec-reviews/issues/22
dka: There's been some movement on WebNFC.  We've had some comments from Anssi, implementor from Intel.  One of people in sysapps WG working on it.  There's an intent to implement in Chrome, August 13, includes more information about implementation approach.  Would be good to get Alex's feedback.
dka: One of the questions on the blink-dev mailing list is whether this is a powerful API that will be HTTPS-only like geolocation.
dka: Not clear that we have an architectural view of this API yet.
Travis: We should do an official spec review write-up and review at an upcoming telecon.
Travis: I'd be happy to take a look.
dka: The version from the community group dated 7 September looks like the right one.

https://github.com/w3ctag/spec-reviews/issues/38
Travis: we skipped over the issue on browser fingerprinting document
mnot: I looked at revised document; reasonably happy with what I saw.  I think Alex had strongest reaction to the previous version, so he should take a look.  I'm happy giving Alex action items in his absence.
mnot: The idea is it's going to be published as an interest group note by the privacy interest group, although there was also discussion about making it a joint publication with the TAG.  So we should discss if we're ok with that.

dka: One thing we we didn't talk with Mike about was the security and privacy checklist.
Travis: Is that the one the WebRTC folks filled out for it?
Yves: Last time we were discussing publishing it as a NOTE.
mnot: I think it's ready for some use.  I think we should have a discussion of how we interact with working groups throughout their life cycle.  If part of that is filling out a questionnaire, or a selection of questionnaires...
hadley: I remember a big rabbit-hole on the subject at our last face-to-face.
hadley: Something about how much we legitimize this by putting our name on it vs. how much we don't it to be too heavy-handed additional process.  Where the balance between something we think is important vs. making the process too heavyweight and not driving people out of our standards process.
mnot: We currently don't have the capability to require people to fill it out.
(Tim arrives)
Yves: The AB could make it part of the process, or requiring a security considerations section.  More in the realm of the AB than the TAG.
mnot: I'm not suggesting that we do, but I think if we want that we should ask them as the TAG rather than leaving it up to the AB.
Yevs: and discuss with AC members as well
dka: We're conflating two separate ctopics.  One is the suciryty and privacy self review questionnaire document, which needs to be updated and have some work done if we want to send it out for wider review in view of publishing as a WG NOTE or TAG finding.  I think publishing as the TAG makes the most sence, although Mike West is the editor.
mnot: Was Yan coediting?
dka: Think so, but not listed on document yet.
dka: That seems like a bunch of production work; need to fix up issues listed at bottom of document.
dka: Take account of feedback we've had so far.
dka: Second question is the more philosophical one of how do people interact with the TAG.
dka: I'm trying to channel Mark's question.  What obligation do people have to go through this checklist.  Right now we don't have that authority.  But just because we don't have that authority doesn't mean we can't publish teh document.
mnot: I agree with taht.  But if we made more effort to communicate clearly with WGs that these are things the TAG thingks irae good.  These are things the TAG thinks are current best practice for writing specs at the w3c.  That becomes a way to communicate our expectations.
hadley: Found meeting minutes from previous discussion.  https://github.com/w3ctag/meetings/blob/gh-pages/2015/04-sfo/04-22-minutes.md  Was in SFO, not Berlin.  Yan proposed we use this as part of TAG spec reviews.  (hadley summarizes minutes)
dka: And it is in a TAG repo URI.
plinss: There was discussion oafterwards about wanting a stable dated URI that folks could refer to.  That's where we came up with publishing as a NOTE so we have it on TR.
dka: Yan, can you take action?
dka: Action would be addressing remaining issues, which would get it ready for publishing as a NOTE.
dka: Like 3.8, does the specification allow origin access.  I think it's a typo: "allow an origin to access sensors".  Right now it just says TODO.  Maybe a later version, but this is the github version so I don't think so.
Yan: Understood.  Is publishing at a versioned URL independent of publishing as a NOTE, b/c I think Tantek wanted the versioned URL as soon as possible.
dka: So let's do that simultaneously.
plinss: Publishing as a note gets us a versioned URL.
dka: I don't think we should publish as a NOTE until we have some text in this.
plinss: We can update NOTEs at will.
dka: I guess as long as we make it clear we're still working on it.
dka: So who's going to...?  Yves?  Publication magic.
Yves: As long as the draft is ready, it's fine.
dbaron: Have as status of the document section?
(Alex arrives)
dka: I'm writing an issue for Yan to address remaining issues.  But we also need Yves to get wheels in motion to publish as a draft note.
dka: This is the security questionnaire.


travis: Alex, we were looking at spec reviews issue 38.  Mark happy with revised version but wanted to make sure you had a chance to look over as well.
Alex: We talked about this in Berlin.  The question for Nick then was where does he want this to go.  Don't remember answer to that.
Alex: Sounds like it's going to a note by privacy interest group
Travis: Any concerns about the content?
Alex: I think we talked through those in unsanctioned tracking finding.  As general advice about what is and isn't responsible to do, we've given the advice that I think is appropriate.   I'm not sure that things like avoid unnecessary increases in the surface area for passive fingerprinting are really meaningful when we talk through the question of entropy.  Side channels are hard to mitigate; we'd have to overhaul system to defend against those issues.  To the extent that this informs private browsing document, more reasonable description of attack / threat model.
Alex?: Much of this document is then generalities.  There's some useful stuff like marking features that contribute to fingerprinting.
Alex: Bits about clearing state possible ossible with Mike's new API.
Alex: Avoid new ??? cookie lifetime is a strange statement.  Compared to our finding.
mnot: Some is stylistic, written as "Avoid X".  It's already a failure of process to add features without use cases.
Alex: <something very fast>
mnot: We crafted unsanctioned tracking for that function.
Travis: You were looking at best practices summary.  Sounds like saying first one not relevant anymore.
Alex: Could be relevant in very constrained environment, e.g., implementing private browsing mode.
Travis: Though it only applies within a constrained environment.
mnot: We could open issues on this repo, give  apull reques, say not insterested in publishing with them.
Alex: Should provide constructive advice, and ask to what extent document we published in June satisfies the same need.
mnot: Think Nick approaching from attitude of a privacy researcher; maybe discuss bringing document closer to purpose as we see it, maybe we could have a constructive conversation.
Alex: maybe I can try to summarize some of this in our issue.
Travis: would be nice to have some constructive proposed changes
mnot: Even if Alex, if we can work on something to kick off conversation, open some bullet-point issues, we can start working on proposed text collaboratively.
Alex: I'll start by putting comments in our issue.
mnot: This document is in its own repo; we could open issues against it directly.
dka: I have another issue on you (Mark) to do with this idea of a special advice for spec authors page.
mnot: I could put a strawman together and we could discuss it on a call.
dka: We could talk about it at TPAC.  In fact, that would be a good place to announce it because we might eb on stage talking about what does the TAG do.  Being able to introduce that page, say we have advice for spec authors, and talk about documents we're referencing.  Taht would be ag good story for us.
mnot: I'm curious to see how much we can collect to put on that   Do a bit of a survey and find out what's already out there.
dka: I think it's a subset.  If you look at publication list from the TAG, it has a whole bunch of findings on it, some of which are not aimed at spec developers, some of which are older and have out-of-date advice.  Is there something with the most timely information:  not only stuff the TAG has published, but other stuff out there that we should make people aware of.  Or, indeed, this fingerprinting document.
mnot: It also gives us a lens to look at things.  We have the extensibel web report card, but do we have something more substantial in terms of advice for spec authors.  Could fill holes there over the long term.

Topic: <keygen>
TimBL: Let me frame it.  When you want to authenticate to somebody:  two ways.  Could use paswords (shared secret).  Other is to have private key.
TimBL: Th world of passwords is fundamentally different from the world of public key.  Public key fundamentally more secure.  Passwords suck in lots of ways.
Alex: keys suck in lots of ways
TimBL: If you share a passowrd, and your machine is owned..
Travis: Or share password, and website compromised
TimBL: People hold to have lots of passwords.  Either share passwords or have to keep record of lots of passwords.
TimBL: So with any serious security relationship, ssh to machine you control, upload to github, you use keys.
TimBL: <link on IRC>
TimBL: Certificates, can install private key on laptop, on physical keyrings.
TimBL: Third way of authentication -- authenticate indirectly, relationship with facebook and use facebook to connect to everything else.
TimBL: Easier for many people -- then only have to maintain relationship with facebook.
TimBL: Disadvantage of that point of view -- where passwords have taken us in a way --
Travis: I agree with what you've said so far
TimBL: -- so when you have a relationship between user and website, e.g., with my own website or with MIT or something -- the process is to mint a private key and keep it on my own systems.
[DKA: another related note: the UK HMRC (tax agency) optionally allows usesrs to identify themselves via a digital certificate (key) instead of a username/password.]
TimBL: Ways of doing this in various browsers, <keygen>, old thing on IE.  Seemed to me this is very useful functionality.
Alex: Which part of it?
TimBL: Ability to mint a private key.   Keep private part on my system and hand public part to whomever I want, and keep it secure.
Alex: Keep secure from what and for how long?
Travis: One thing is keep it from javascript so JS can't have access to keys.
TimBL: Clearly can't be anywhere where a bit of JS can get it.
TimBL: I would want bank of america to run a program that can ... my private key
Alex: Key provision and key use are two separate points in time.
Alex: who is anybody else?
TimBL: Anybody else, except for my kids if I let them log in on my computer.
Alex: What are ???
TimBL: Certificate store where I can manage them -- delete cruft.    One thing with <keygen> -- many things crummy with keygen -- hashes the whole system uses -- the way the API works.  Expect JS api but it's HTML tag.  But it's a pain, but it works.  Developer and user have to go through a pain.  Lack of ability for JS to pick up where it left off when user has the cert.  What it gives me is tvaluable -- giwhen I pick a certificate -- when website asks me what certificate I want to use -- have MIT one, on for lab, etc. -- then I know my browser asks me for certificate, and doing TLS, because little thing comes down that's hard to phish.  Thing comes down in browser chrome. 
Alex: Browser UI specifically designed to tie to unforgeable bits.
TimBL: Things about UI I'd really like to improve.  e.g. firefox doesn't ... used to not remember choice when you checked.  Chrome remembers during session, but have to choose again every session.  For lots of people where you use Web IDs -- public presence -- ... in the future you'd have a small number of certs and manage them.  What's valuable about this is that my public identi.  Things valuable about public key in general, and things valuable about way keygen works in browser that allows store manage and delete the cert.  Particular with Web IDs - public key URL that points to public profile with public key, then you demonstrate that you are the owner of the web page.  
Alex: how is that attestation made?
mnot: I wasn't aware of keygen before this came up.  But many benefits seem to be client side certs ratehr than keygen in particular.
TimBL: Has to use <keygen> because the key is generated on your computer -- nobody else has it.
Alex: A few properties we should disentangle.  Keygen.  X.509 cert handling with
 particular mime type.
TimBL (draws): 
  secure authentication
    pub key
      keygen
        X509 - ASN/1
        MD5
     <keygen> API
TimBL: more reasonable concern MD5 out of date
Alex: now completely broken
TimBL: Lots of people using these systems.  So also with keygen you get.  Functionality of generating key pair without sending secret to something else is really important; keygen the only way of doing it.
TimBL: Lots of issues:  no notification that it works.  
Travis: disconnect between request and response from server
Travis: hard to correlate those two actions
TimBL: shouldn't be rocket science
TimBL: Something in the client wants to return -- could use an HTML form -- could POST it.
Travis: It's an asyncronous activity that doesn't...
TimBL: Takes a while to do the math of generating key.  Is that why it's async, or is it asking user for permission?
Travis: Up to whatever policies the server has before they send a certificate back.
Alex: Two things cooperating.  <keygen> which creates a local private key that's not available to scripting context.  <keygen> also had the ability to create a challenge about the content at the site wants to have the ability to understand the user it's signing for in order to create a chain of trust to key generation on teh server side.
TimBL: didn't understand
Alex: Say use case is proof of possetion.  Would like to prove computer owned by specific person.  To do that you need to make sure the chanllenge -- the return signed public key is authenticated with -- is valid.  The MD5 issue.
Alex: Third issue is X.509 certificate installation using a mime type.  Implicated in almost every discussion on the mailing list.
Alex: Usually you're installing as trusted a public key which has been generated -- a cert -- which has been generated as a derivative 
Peter: It's your certicifacate, signed by the server, used by a specific mime type which causes your browser  to install it.
Peter: keygen just generates the public/private key.  Getting the certificate back -- comes back with a mime type.
Alex: On the POST response -- you post your public key and signed challenge.
Alex: Today that MIME type in Firefox triggers specific UI about firefox managed keystore.
Alex: Other browsers -- Chrome doesn't necessarily  show UI -- may just import the key.  On Mac int keychain, on windows using crypto api.
Alex: This behavior is separable and part of the conversation, but not well explored.
Alex: key installation without user intervention seems tobe a desired property of ewb ID contingent.  There's another property which is the inability of the initiating web page to see the private key at any point.  Whose value for the web ID purposes I don't understand.
TimBL: Why would you want the web page js to see the private key?
Alex: Why is it necessary that it doesn't?
Peter: Security -- Never expose your private key to anyone.
Alex: Demonstrably false -- it's going to be on your system.
Alex: I'm not asking why you'd want to -- I'm asking why you need to forbid it.
TimBL: Private key only used for establishing TLS sessions under my control.  Being available in any context reduces security.
Alex: I'm on example.com.  I go to a key provision page.  Through some mechanism, it generates a private key on my system in the eap of the web page.  Potentially, out of view of the page, which <keygen> does today, or web crypto might, or potentially in the page, but not to third parties because we have the same origin policy.  What happens next is the same.  You use a challenge that the server generates/requires, send signed public key key back to the server, and get a certificate which through some mechaism you're going to install.  That's the flow keygen was designed to enable.
alex: why in this flow is it such an incredibly strong property that the private key material that you're going to use are never available to example.com
Peter: that allows example.com to impersonate you in the future
Alex: to example.com
Peter: the use of that certificate is not restricted to example.com.  Once that certificate is in your store you can present it anywhere -- use to log in to your bank.
Alex: Do you trust example.com to?
Peter: you trust them to generate the certificate, but you don't trust them with your private key
Peter: The keygen code is generating the private key on your browser and on your machine.  That's fundamental.
Alex: If example.com is trying to do proof of possesion, none of those properties are necessary.
TimBL: If you have another use case with e.g., mit.???.com. 
lower security where you want to mint a local private key.  But in the use cases we have of the Web ID use case, generating a cert for you as an MIT faculty or student, that will will be unacceptable breach of security.
Alex: MIT needs to authenticate users of MIT systems to MIT?
TimBL: The MIT cert, once I have it, can use for big list of websites some of which are in mit.edu, 
Yves: imagine booking room in hotel with cert showing from MIT
TimBL: or browse journals
Travis: so bottom line is you don't trust site that's doing the keygen
pteer: and you don't trust the network between you and the site
Travis: And since you don't trust the network you don't trust JS which has ready access to the network
Alex: You'd be using TLS
Peter: TLS never involves sending private key across the wire
Dan: Is this particular requriement -- the key if you will -- the one that is the issue?  And if you take it as ?? that this is a requirement, are there other capabilities.  You mentioned something around Web Crypto API.  And the idea that some future version of web crypto api might provide similar funcitonality.  Tell UA something but don't make it available to JS context.
TimBL: There's no keygen equivalent in web crypto.
TimBL: One possibility, what I would expect, is to add ...
Peter: I believe there's an api where you can generate public/private key pair, but it gives you the private key back.
dka: I'm positing we ask the web crypto people, if we think that's abetter approach, can we ask them to add this?  So web pages can direct browser to create public/private key parr and not give theprivate key.
Alex: There's a flag on the key generating api in web crypto called extractable=false.  Means the page is not going to be trusted with the private key.   Not sure about implementation support.  Active debate about whether it should even be possible.  Partly because generated private key and putting it in the local keystore is an activity that should require user interaction -- but today with keygen it doesn't.
TimBL: I though some browser pops up an alert about installing certificate.
Peter: Notification for generating certification, consent for installing certificatie.
Alex: First one should be user consent.
Peter: There's no harm allowing JS to initiate this, but it shouldn't complete without user interaction.
TimBL: I'm not totally sure about that.
TimBL: thing else, e.g., not use system-wide local keystore
TimBL: ??? option of a keyring
Peter: In general UI around client certificates is so completely broken around every browser I've ever seen.
TimBL: When browser UI is used by people in the browser vendor company it improves -- MIT, NYU, Americ...
alex: because MD5 is broken, Google would never use a keygen-generated key
TimBL: passwords?
alex: we provision keys out of band
TimBL: (draws on whiteboard)... executable ...
alex: FIDO ...
TimBL: Don't want people to use alternative of running an executable on their system.
TimBL: If you go out of band you run the executable
alex: this physical token...
alex: I'm trying to tease apart the use cases.  Large enterprises are trying to system enrollment in a certificate provision schingem.  A large percentage of that pool of people who want keygen like functionality -- is provisioning keys on systems that they own.  Question of ownership hangs over all of this.  For enterprises that own devices, their use case is sorted out of out of band.
alex: ... FIDO specs coming -- api surface in near future -- much safer provisioning of keys, and hardware attestation which is signifacantly better.  Something you know plus something you have.  Because it's software it isn't really something you have.  Smart cards are "something you have"; FIDO provides a channel to other kinds of "something you have".
alex: can I know that the keys correspond to something that hasn't left the device.  You want to lodge a key as a one time operation as quickly as possible.  THe private key should never leave the token.
timbl: that thing has a private key that never leaves it
dka: it feels to me like if we're talking about web... hardware provisioning of keys or even out of band -- the keygen use case of generating something and having private key not available to scripting context.  If it is indeed a feature of the web crypto api.  Could the TAG say that if keygen is being deprecated by browsers, then this feature is an important one, because of the security issues -- and some web applications may want to use that same functionality.  Way to do that is this feature of the web crypto api ,nd therefore improtant that implementations implement this feature of the web crypto api [is there a "middle way"?]
Travis: anything of that naturet hat FIDO apis will provide?
dka: already something in the web crypto api.  We can say stuff about w3c apis
timbl: and we can read the spec
dka: I'd rather not say that FIDO is the answer when we don't even know what FIDO looks like yet.
dka: We've already got web crytpo, spent a lot of time talking to web crypto.  Approach they're taking with allowing web developers building ui allowing interaction with the crypto system throug this api.
travis: no web crypto api today that instructs ua to...
alex: there is
dka: he said there is, but isn't implemented
peter: webpage that provisions key, and runs keygen, and runs JS -- I as as user can't tell whether it has access to my key without reading code.
peter: I don't get the user interaction from the browser itself giving me the confidence.
travis: We're asserting they should be propertise of an api used for this purpose
alex: should a web page be allowed to modify something that has a global impact on the system?
peter: not without user intecartion
peter: with permission
alex: question of how strog the origin model is
alex: to modify the system has to be out of band
travis: this is why we have user prompts for camera, microphone -- non origin tied resources  we're asserting key stotarge is another one fo those system
timbl: you could have origin key storage if you want.
timbl: one aspect of public key crypto is that key is public.  This is cool.  That kinda breaks the origin model.
peterl: also a security feature that others can verify out of band
timbl: it provides security to completely public thing
travis: we're talking about same origin limiting of the private key piece, such that pthe private key would be hashed to gether with certain origin information and only valid ofr use there.  If ??? were the case you ???
travis: Thus it needs to be user consent to store that private key.
dka: could somebody then use web components to create a keygen which used ...
alex: you could create a keygen-alike
travis: though the characteristics would be fundamentally different from today, since there would be user interaction required
travis: that's some very concrete feedback we as the TAG could give to..
dka: travis would you be comfortable writing somethnig up?
alex: I'd like to make sure whatever we write up ackwonegdges that user agents don't have responsibility to modify global keystore.
dka: can't uas use global keystor or local one?
alex: This is part of the problem with keygen, vastly underspecified.
alex: no requirement to modify global keystore, psecifically without user interaction.
timbl: one of your posts was -- said something about user agent doesn't control -- manage trust of other machine.  That's not a ??? thing.  I think that's a bug not a feature.  Because in fact people  when people do everything ne thi browser, the use of the certificate is in the browser.  ... have to check a box.  In Firefox  vs. in Chrome for Mac regards as somebody else's (keychain's) problem.  The browser's job is a user's agent.  When user agent is helping me establish relationship with someboy, ... the fact that the key is public to everybody dosen't mean that browsers are out of ??? tohelp me understand that and make it as smooth as possible.  I agree if it's porvisioning the radio on my phone that should happen out of band.
alex: I'm the last person to argue that things shouldn't happenin the browser.  I'm arguing something slightly different -- that we need a different trust model for those non origin model operations.  We need a different trust model -- I'd like to see one created, and like to work on it.  But it requires we're honest that the same origin policy is today the only game going, so that things that happen outside of that policy need to be treated specially, whether by the os or browser provided UI.  It odes'nt happen in things we're going to grandfather in to the same origin policy because it just happens to runinng in the browser.
timbl: the effects of the same origin policy -- cment in the silo world we have today that different websites don't talk to each other
alex: thesame origin policy gives sites enough trust that they can mediate that conveersation for themselves
timbl: the user is left out of the loop.  When you do what the user wants, like mac calendar pulls data from lots of different servers, each one atuhenticaes to as me.  Ideally it could pull multiple calendars together with my same identity.  And really importan they're displayed all together.
alex: but it does that using protocols that create consent between each of the actors.  It is an agent for me to my private and public google calendar my wifes calendar, etc. -- those areseparate entities -- authenticating individually- - and composing the view.  Third parties trusting that I was the user because implemented the protocol.
timbl: because shared passwords between each one
alex: or generated one time password, or ...
alex: my calendar isn't active content which interacts with other active content.
alex: my calendar application doesn't create opportunity for two calendars to have  a fight
timbl: if I want to write that as a web page, when I tried to access the data, I'm not loading a script, I'm just accessing data.  The browser treats the webapp that I'm using -- treates XHR -- pretty much the same as loading a script -- doesn't trust the developer.  You trust your calendar program -- istalled on the mac -- can do whatever it likes on the network.  No way of installing a webpage and giving it trust.  Can't trust the user because we feel somebody can bambooz/e the user -- therefore feel that we can't give the web platform any power.  Inetersted in non origin model with concept of trusted code.  Users out there in the world who  -- developers who feel that finding some ways of managing trusted web apps just like you manage installing apps on your phone
alex: that's going to require policy or a way to integrate that isn't the origin model
alex: which is why the web crypo example is brought up for key provisioninig -- if you want to allow user to install things into local system -- create key -- generate stronger challenge/response inside web page.    certificate -- do this in script.  And then have it download.  You don't have to do exact same thing as what keygen does today -- specific in-browser UI  -- most systems that most users have -- if you download a key bundel and double-cilck it -- it will do something.  OSX does this, Windows, Android.  iOS doesn't allow provisioning.
timbl: iOS allows you to mail you a cert
alex: linux is the odd man out, since no key storage system.  system wide.  Linux can't decide what linux is.
alex: Firefox has its own local key store. 
timbl: has some advantages
alex: and reduces consistency across applications
dbaron: also some momentum there
dka: travis, you were on the verge o taking an action
dka: can we take that action, write this up, with some potential reservations, and then revisit those recommendations onec Trais has written them up
timbl: recommendations are that 
timbl: can we rocemmend that keygen is kept until ??? is available
alex: I don't think we've recommended removing keygen until use cases we see are satisfied -- but keygen's usage in Chrome is impossibly low.
timbl: I have to use it once a year
peter: At HP  we have our own internal certificateprovisioning system -- instructions say to use Firefox or IE.  The fact that you see no usage doesn't mean there's no usage.
aalex: the same users who might be using keygen are also the same users who via enterprise policy might be opting out of telemetry reporting
alex: users who opt in -- not all of our users -- report on problems that we put in.
alex: the pre-intent-to-deperecate was about finding out if there are large users affected.  MIT is relatively unique here.
timbl: happens to be that university I work at and bank that I use use certificates
mnot: in http2  we don't allow client certs to be used, since we disallow TLS renegotation -- downgrade to 1.1
mnot: widely agreed since renegotiation makes TLS such a complex protocol that you can't even analyze its security properties
mnot: the way you do client certs is TLS renegiota --if the resource requires a client cert, triggers renegotiation .  When you first set up connection you negot cypher suites and keypairs.  
peter: SNI has..
mnot: SNI not encrypted
mnot: One thing I say I as evangelize HTTP2 is saying you can't use client certs.  I've been surprised by amount of pushback.  So there's a large audience for client certs, although admittedly that's not keygen.
mnot: I think improving user experience for client certs is a net win -- question is how to do that with least amount of pain.
travis: out of our jurisdiction to improve UX of client certs
pteer, tim: no, it's not
travis: we can say that current implementations of client cert selection  are a terrible experience and users can't figure out how to use them?
peter: even experts can't figure out how to use them
timbl: it's a crucial feature -- ability to bury a key inside a user's computer
travis: we're just talking about selection of a client certificate for use in authentication
travis: we believe that experience can be massivly improved and we want to call on implemnatitons to impove
mnot: but it's hard
mnot: in some cases it's that the browser and trust store are separate components owned by different people
timbl: why does that make it difficult?
mnot: it's an organizational problem.  The browsers have shipped with knowledge of roots certs.  Browsers could have overlay knowledge of client certs.
Yves: MIT also has CA cert.  One thing that is also missing is scoping of certificates.
TimBL: Rathole!
TimBL: What ??? is saying about keygen is that it would behoove the clients to having a better UI.
Travis: But that is unrelated to keygen.
timbl: key selection can be improved by providing more information be certificates
peter: anotheng big thing missing in certificate selection is the ability to revoke selection.  Teh problem now is that startssl uses client certs.
timbl: oh, during session
peter: if I guess and pick the wrongcert, I'll get a failed to negot SSL error, and I have no way to clear and choose a different cert without restarting browser.  And once logged in, I can't log out.
timbl: Nice UI like persona UI that ... identity ... button ... Easy to have two WebIDs for 2 different things and switch identtiy.
travis: in terms of HTTP protocol -- improve use of client certificates.  
mnot: ux, definitely not.  Protocol interactions -- how do we negotiate client certs in the protocol without renegotiation -- that's going to happen but purely on the wire.  If we can take advice on how to design protocol to mesh in with UX, happy for advice.
timbl: If ???, the user just clicked "always use the certificate with this website".  When you design HTTP, you could use that.
mnot: Do we need a pseudo-HTTP-auth scheme that leverages client certs.
peterl: It's a problem that HTTP auth and client certs are at two different levels of the architecture.
mnot: today a lot of auth is done using cookies but fantastic control of UX with no security guranatees
mnot: with http auth (digest) some security guarantees and ??? ux, then with client certs stronger security guraantees and worse ux
timbl: ux desginers ... control of protocol
mnot: actually pretty easy to bridge.
timbl: just like a bad idea that you have a bad idea tell fetch you have to use this flag.  use credentials flag.  Whether the user has decided to use cert with given website  -- can design as part of experience -- can put as paraemeter.
travis: we covered provisioning -- which is keygen -- and what we'd like to see with web crypto.
travis: the assertion that implementors should responsibly deprecate 
timbl: when they have something that works better
travis: ack that md5 is weak
travis: talked about client certificate selection and use
travis: didn't called out mimehandling installation of cert that's sent back from server
travis: I think alex implied they won't allow that cert to be installed automatically
timbl: short term fix -- easy -- is to ask the user before doing these things
timbl: improving keygen to md5->sha2 and changing protocol s much longer term
timbl: do people feel ... would security community be able to rip out md5...
alex: we're trying.  md5 signed certificates finally deprecated from browsers.  certificate chanins that relpy on md5 for security properties aren't being honored anymore.
timbl: instead SHA?
alex: yes, preferably 256
alex: ecosystem challenge browsers currently wading through.  Even though could ptoentially use md5 in a few scenarious that aren't known yet to be broken, still shouldn't be trusted.  The goal is to ensure untrustworthy crypto removed from ecosystem.
timbl: don't have to remove it from routers
timbl: the reason dnssec didn't take off was having to change routers
alex: also have to deply new certificates -- long lived md5 certificates or intermediaries -- ongoing challenge.  roughly succeeded.
alex: Chrome users no longer experience d5 signing of intermed certs
travis: html5 rec says only sign with md5, rsa keys, doesn't say being removed or anything like that, but that statement is bold and red in latest draft but not in lrecommendation document
timbl:recommendation to change that in html5?
timbl: if keygen signed with sha would still be fine?
alex: some issues earlier still exist
alex: form transmitted in (PKCS#7) still suspect.used only primarily for this.  Doesn't conform to generally accepted way to structure signed message for security.
timbl: ?
alex: it's easier to trick systems that use this particular kind of encoding to do the wrong thing because of the way the message is structured
alex: There's a now generally accetped way to pack and unpack HMAC'd messages, and that's not what's done here.
alex: A large part of effective crypto in the wild is making sure implementations are as simple as possible.
travis: another keygen problem is that you can't choose any of these options through declarative model
timbl: interesting question here -- comment about keygen is requires user to set key length.  Why should the user know anything about key length?
travis: just always pick strong!
timbl: maybe browser should not generate 1K keys because that's 
timbl: the browser is my agent and knows what's safe -- shouldn't let me create a key that's too short
travis: I'd like a stameent about what we can say about keygen
timbl: should not be removed until there's a functional and better alternative
alex: dramatically underspecified, uses suspect crypto
timbl: say MD5 rather than "suspect crypto"; 
dka; Travis, I think you have what you need.  Could you write up what you think we've just said and then we can look at it offline later.

Lunch

Jeff Joins us

Jeff: The TAG is doing a great job.
Jeff: Security of the Web - "security is broken" - many attacks on web content perpetrated, public, well-known. Some people lose confidence of the security of communicaitons on the web. Implementation problems / arch problems / human engineering. Last week we had our AB meeting. The AB asked to do a domain review of the 5 domains - ask each domain leader to report on that domain. [minute link when it is published]. We got stuck when it came to security, It came up in tech&society domain. There were 2 AB members that were vocal that we do not have enough going to improve the security of the web. Do we need a "security area" i.e. IETF? Do we need a stronger security reviews of our specs? Security is analagous to accessibility in this regard. This arose as a major issue. Wendy will come back and propose some stuff at AB meeting in Sapporo. During the discussion, Tantek pointed out the security checklist. https://w3ctag.github.io/security-questionnaire/ - the webRTC group has also filled out and said "it's a complete waste of time" so some difference of opinion. High level: security needs continued vigilence.
Mark: We have webapsec - they are good stewards of security in the platform.
Jeff: webappsec got good feedback in the discussion.
Mark: If AB is talking about technical focus areas and things about the architecture then we need better coordination.
Jeff: We're not talking about architecure in the Ab but are talking about process.
Mark; This is one of the areas where AB and TAG touch.
Alex: are there specific areas where people feel discomfitted about security story?
Jeff: I've discussed with Virginie - first and formost from her is the security reviews issue. Not enough resource in the IG to do this. Another issue : in her view if you have a secure piece of hardware then that should be helpful in enhancing security on the web - [a Gemalto view.] In the webcrypto group we have created an API that allows a browser to take advantage of capabilities of the smartcard. There are more things the smeartcard could help with. The webcrypto group has not worked on that. She would like to start another group about hardware assisted web auth - possibly chartering that group.
Alex: What's the overlap between that and FIDO?
Jeff: FIDO alliance is working more on multi-factor auth. Strong consensus in w3c that web needs a multifactor auth solution. There is discussion between FIDO and W3C on that.
Alex: We reviewed Credential management API, it would be good to see the use cased solved by integrating FIDO in that API (re: hardware tokens)
Alex: hardware-based security is tricky because of the characteristic it implies on the runtime (single-threaded, non forking, etc...)
Jeff: another issue is security in the internet of things (IoT), we have an emerging project (Web of Things) and the first thing people say is that security is an issue. They have a security TF looking into that.
Jeff: there is also Web Auto, with issues on security for automotive
Mnot: When you see at how TV of Automotive people adapt the Web stack, there are issues and it has consequences on the securirty model. We talked earlier about how to address that.
Jeff: it would be good if the group would produce a finding saying that adapting the web stack while not fully embracing it has issues would produce such document.
Hadley: I think we could do it in such a way that doesn't discourage progress and experimentation; just doesn't ask us/the Web to guarantee the results.
Mnot: we may need a spec saying "this set of specs is the Web", it would also be a nice clarifying tool.
Alex: it would be good to document the risks if you go outside of this.
Travis: there are different profiles depending if you are a browser or a content processor.
Jeff: no browser implemented _all_ W3C Recs, there could be a definition of the minimum set required.

Jeff: You can deputize your alumni, to help with outreach
TimBL: having a greater TAG, or "Friends of the TAG" including people who know the stack might help.
Dan: Jeni and Henry started AWWW vol2, that we dropped when we started to focus more on spec reviews.
Mnot: the Web can be seen two ways, an information space or a browser-centric view.
Mnot: this is a long-term thing.
Travis: it needs to be approachable.
Jeff: It would be good to do some breakouts during TPAC. Also it would be good to not consider it a long-term project.
David: Implementers are providing review of specs, including security. It would be good to have a way to write that knowledge.
David: Not sure that an IG is the place to do security review, there is a need to know previous exposures, check they are not there, and think about possible new issues in specs.
Jeff: that's what they aspire to do, just need to have the right set of members in it.

Jeff: We've been moving more charter reviews into the public. If we continue in that vein, it should be easier for the TAG to get involved earlier.
Mark: If we think carefully about the comms...
David: Part of the problem is information overload. Some more general indicators of where things are in the process, dashboards...

Discussion on policy - 
Dan,Mark,Hadley - [outlining the current view of the TAG on policy-related statements - our view that we take policy positions based on interpreations of web technology and web architecture which can positively influence the policy discussion to make the Web work - e.g. securing the web, e.g. end-to-end encryption, e.g. 
Jeff: Generally speaking the W3C practice has been to have "no opinion" on public policy issues. In recent years this has been changing. Security & pervasive monitoring, drm, do not track, etc...  Over the past several years w've been struggling to figure out what to do and what to say. Community has different stakeholders. The Team is frustrated. They care about the Web and the policy matters. They aspire that w3c speak out and yet w3c as a matter of practice doesn't speak out. But we are at a situation now that more than the team cares. When the pervasive monitoring revelations came out and w3c joined other organizations in speaking out that was contraversial. Others in the AC wanted us to to more. Have been discussing in the AB. In particular in April the AB for the first time said we should do more. In the AB we've been trying to figure out what more we can do. In last week's meeting we had a straw man proposal presented for a policy interest group. Would start as a discussion forum, discuss policy issues we think are important to the web. We are trying to figure out what the deliverables are. We are going to take microsteps. Maybe have a policy IG without any formal deliveravles and then at a future point of time figure out what a policy note might look like. We'll take it up again at Sapporo. We might want to discuss together [with the TAG] at our joint meeting there. Here is a good example of a charter that the TAG could get involved with. https://www.w3.org/2015/09/draft-polig-charter.htm 
Mark: how does this interface with the web foundation?
Jeff: the WF as an independent foundation expresses its own PoV on policy matters. They are more on the advocacy side compared to w3c members.
[discussion on policy IG scope]
Tim: with e.g. DNT it requires policy designers to cooperate with technical spec. A policy statement from w3c saying "this will only work if the following policy work happens" [makes sense.] [Or e.g.] if you want to regulate cookies let's do it together...
Mark: I'm concerned that if you have something that's just a policy group then you could get to an isolated state.
Hadley: I'm concerned about that as well. We did some planning [at mozilla] about policy and then Snowden happened and the community was so incensed that the conversation ran away. ... this in w3c will need have strong facilitation and a really clear, technical scope  to be successful.

Topic: Spec reviews.
* WebRTC
https://github.com/w3ctag/spec-reviews/issues/14
mnot: major concern is that it exposes the local ip addresses of the use agent because of the negotiation of NAT traversal. There is a concern about exposing IP addresses in general. One thing surprising people is that using a VPN your local IP address can be revealed (and it is also possible using flash).
Some useful links: http://mozillamediagoddess.org/2015/09/10/webrtc-privacy/
https://wiki.mozilla.org/Media/WebRTC/Privacy and http://www.w3.org/2015/09/09-webrtc-minutes.html#item06
ACTION: mnot to draft a summary


Topic: telcon time
mnot: dst again, considering moving the time of the telcon one hour back after TPAC (when DST changes will be done everywhere).
... looks like we have consensus.
dbaron: I think the proposal is just to keep the meeting pinned to 20:00 UTC across both the Australia and Northern hemisphere time changes.


https://github.com/w3ctag/spec-reviews/issues/18
Dan: issue is assigned to Alex
Alex: not tracked since things are moving around.
Alex: still strange not be able to query the API for resources (like an image).
the API is in general pretty good, main issue is that people ask for more.
Dan: it is worth keeping the issue open? -> change the milestone

Dan: other specs we need to review?
Travis: Shadow-DOM

Mnot: on the IETF front: jsonbis <http://datatracker.ietf.org/wg/jsonbis/charter/>
Mnot: opportunistic security, got one implementation. <https://github.com/httpwg/http-extensions#http-opportunistic-security>
Mnot: 451, client-hints (related to device information used for conneg).

(discussion on future meetings)
ADJOURNED.
