Keygen

dan: Some flareup on discussion x-posted to tag ml
dan: do we need to say anything else?
Mark: : [is this] outside of our remit? ... are people trying to use the TAG to short-circut implementers?
Travis: Agree.
... I think we don't have anything substantial more to say - web platform wg owns the decision - they've made the decision. 
... I didn't see anything there too contraversial.
... looked like folks happy and excctant for something like fido to come in....
... suggestion is to let that thrad burn out.

[agreed]

Credentials Management

Travis: Fido is now called web authentication....
... some potential issues - a security issue about having a writable name/value on the credential has been addressed.
... other issue - an alignment between web auth and credential management
... at least good enough for Chrome to issue intent to ship 
Alex: possibly going out in 53
Travis: looked at ... couple of points we can make back to web auth wg....
... Open issue is that both WA and cred management API define credential interface - syntactically identical. cred management subclasses that.
... web auth creates a site object called scoped credential info wich contains a credentials. With TAG hat: probably that's the same thing as a
... site bound credentialb ut the protocol in each case is a little bit different. So I have an outstanding question / issue to [them] on that.
... in web authentication the JS only needs to get the cred to pass it on to the server... 
... when it uses it it doesn't need the cred anymore - just needs assertion ...
... so looking at that use case and having credentials in the cred management API - are they the same [...] or not?
... Also: in cred management there is a statement that the UA may use the public suffix list to share the cred with accounts.google.com if it was made in google.com.
... that allowance is there but you woud have a user mediation step... I think that's acceptable.
Alex: wrt the fido Utld+1 question - one thing I came to udnerstand to use UTLD+1 - in some cases the designers don't view it as a securit system but as a privacy system.
... that's a different kind of question. Security question doesn't show up. 
... in FIDO case of iframing question - [...] same pattern could be applied to that [...] privacy implications seem less scary than the security implications...
Travis: I'd like to close - issue 49.
... but issue 97 already tracks other feedback.

Native Code proposed issue
https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-tag/2016Jun/0005.html

Dan: is there an architectural issue at stake or not?
Alex: question is : should browsers provide privelegded services which are not self-hosted within the browser? I don't know of a way to make a browser that doesn't involve [that]. 
Travis: what is "native code"?
Alex: in the native messaging case you are talking to something that exists outside the security model... but to get there you have to be in the extension system... so "off our planet"
... the case of web payments is inetresting - an API call provided by the browser which becomes a service call on the device which is not available using web tech.
... have had some discussions with [people] about this - because of high priority of getting on-device payment into web down it seems as though there is a path using promises and a reg mechanism to
... create an extensibility point - to allow you to self-host a payment back-end mechanism.
... conflates extensibility and self hosted with question of native code... 
Travis: how is this different from register protcol handlers?
Alex: Foreign fetch API is moving quickly.... You can imagine a world where you gave foreign fetch - make a request to edge.ms.com/version# - and that falls back to 
... extension-like protocol could be behind that...
... could be lightter-weight way to do integration of non-browser things into the web... is that a good idea? [dunno]

Alex: I will respond.
