# Unblocking HTTPS Transitions

[Brad's Proposal](http://webappsec-test.info/~bhill2/DifferentTakeOnOE.html)

Brad: we talked about HTTPS transitions in Berlin. 

Brad: [explains proposal]

Travis: It depends on alternate services work being done?

Brad: I think the alt-svc helps advertise availability, but really you just need a new ALPN token.

Alex: How does this affect handshakes?

Brad: It would add latency to sites that don't offer secure services.

Peter: You're doing that on port 80?

Brad: No, on port 443.

Alex: Is there a notion of a timeout for ALPN discovery / understanding? How long should a UA cache the decision for?

Brad: That's where the alt-svc header comes in.

Peter: Next steps?
