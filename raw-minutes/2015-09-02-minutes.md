Topic <KeyGen>
tim: "broken" may be a stretch
... would love to get the folks attacking keygen to come and share the POV.
... folks that use browsers may say keygen doesn't work for them
... folks that write browsers may be OK, but want to remove
... same origin leads to silo problem (at the expense of decentralization)
... a lot of the arguments against keygen are it generates a global identity.
... we want to have different identities for different websites.
... like the http/https, it took us a long time to come to common ground and find a solution.
dka: have heard some chatter on webappsec on same origin policy.
... might like to look into that and understand any flaws there.
... we also need to understand how these relate.
... I've put it on the agenda for Boston.
alex: I'm not aware of any work in webappsec trying to define an alternate to same-origin policy
dka: my impression is they are building things on top of same-origin and address certain issues
alex: I see it as making same origin strong and removing grandfathered exceptions.
tim: alex, interested in discussion about why same origin policy is harmful for users?
alex: of course.
