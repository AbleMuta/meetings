Polyfill feedback

Andrew: parsing some feedback....
...some issues....
...issue of defering to native...

Alex: Universal support redline - but older browsers haven't got it
...another potental red line - lots of commitments to ship and half of your user base has it available.
...third scenario: a low number of users have it implemented
...these are different in kind

Andrew: great - that helps.
... another one - one browser just doesn't implement and presents no intention of doing so.

Andrew: broadens the socpe of the fidning too much...

Alex: what is goal - the TAG might not want to provide web performance advice - but polyfills should not destroy web performance .. best practices for loading poliyfills are encouraged... 

Andrew: I think that's good.

Andrew: same situation - I'm saying this is a specific best practice - if it applies then you shoul duse it but calling it put specofocally is out of scope

Alex: Yeah.

Andrew: Same approach.
