Sorted By Person:
    
    Hadley:
        
        Issue 20: Can we change the title to say "web API"? 
            Can't we just change this to "browser API"? How about "client side" API? We have agreement! It shall be client-side APIs
        Issue 14: Naming thingsâ€¦  
            Seems very editorial and a bit controversial. We might say "don't use names that are confusing." Alex: names get meaning by "sign-post" their name, and context (where it's being called). [Alex wrote a suggestion in the issue; we agreed on it.]
            
	Alex:
		Like Travis, didn't do my homework. In Seattle today, at WebVR meeting...
		
		VR Issues: 
		   * High resolution framerate for VR (unique to VR displays)
		   * Offscreen canvas really wanted for high-performance rendering
		Dan:
		   * Saw a really cool demo on large-group VR shared experience--was really cool (Maybe this VR thing will actually work)

	Dan:
		Issue https://github.com/w3ctag/design-principles/issues/22  Web APIs are not in fact just for JavaScript - ALEX to research
			Alex: WebASM has no specific API binding--they must go through DOM today as well... so, not sure what we could say about it. Will keep the issue open until we get an update on WebASM
		Issue 13: Tracking, privacy, fingerprinting and user consent   -- TRAVIS to implement Decision
			https://github.com/w3ctag/design-principles/issues/13 Considering adding a small amount of text for securit/privacy OR just linking to the existing docs. There is value in linking (so that things to get out of date as they evolve in the corresponding docs).
		Issue 9 : https://github.com/w3ctag/design-principles/issues/9 Add justifications 
			Hmm, this issue may have become irrelevant. OTOH, maybe we need a bit of a high-level principle explainer before we jump right in.
		Issue 8 https://github.com/w3ctag/design-principles/issues/8 Socially-Motivated Web Design Principles
			Hadley: may be some good to come from pulling together our thoughts on social motivations for API design.. but perhaps that should be in another document.. Will close this issue.
