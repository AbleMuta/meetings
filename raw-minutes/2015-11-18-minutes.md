Topic: Audio Output
https://github.com/w3ctag/spec-reviews/issues/91

Travis: stil in progress yet but between Alex & I we think there is nice architectural model. I will figure out what that [audio] pipeline looks like.
Peter: integrating with video that has an audio stream?
Travis: yes. it would include that. Will work on that - let's shoot for mid December [to come back to it]
[Agreed 16th.]

Topic: Secure Stop Issue

Travis: I have some text I drafted and shared with Alex & will now share.
https://github.com/w3ctag/wiki/wiki/Shutdown
[reviewing this document]
[Issue around shut-down. What happens when a web session shuts down.]
Dan: is this about when a tab closes, or when the browser quits? And what about environments like Firefox OS [or chromecast] where the web run time is powering everything?
Travis: I want to address both sets of requirements. in EME they are specifcally talking about closing a tab or a session, but they also want to cover the case where the whole browser is shutting down.
Peter: Ties into the navigation issues...
Mnot: [tweet tweet]
Travis: it's about the user being done with the site....
Mnot: I'm reminded of all the different efforts to define what a web browsing session is. The web is stateless. So this is inherently a heuristic.
Travis: it's about that signaling. The client-server communication is stateless but in EME they are expecting a follow-up with some update info...
Mnot: a startup event is maybe less problematic.
Travis: I welcome anyone to take a look at this ane leave your comments.
Mnot: Could turn out to be a rat's nest.
Travis: [could be a long hard slog]
Peter: Next steps â€“ will you do another round with Alex?
Travis: Yes - I get pinged about this from the EME co-chairs. They want to get this issue resolved.
Peter: Is this going to mollify them?
Travis: Nope.
Mnot: it might allow them to move forward on their spec.
Peter: when you navigate and when you close a tab sometimes browsers save state [e.g. form state]. that may be something to tie into this - if the browser is supposed to flush state.
Mnot: that brings up a point - what's the interaciton between this and clearing cookies / privacy mode. If the user is trying to clear state then you're in a tug-of-war.
Travis: you need to draw a line of what the content of the web is trying to do and what the jusistiction of the browser is in control.
Dan: this is a general issue that we keep bumping up against.
Travis: we're stewards of the web - some of these concepts like privacy depend on controls that are out of the scope of what's in the web.
[discussion on specifying super-cookie support]
Peter: we want to make sure that when the user flushes cache that this happens and this doesn't get in the way.
Peter: other thing comes to mind - in css we get requests around page transitions. this gets derered because there is no way to tie into things that exist outside the page. Maybe this could provide some hooks for this.
Travis: As a user I would expect to have a seamless transition experience but as a web author I only own half the experience [across origins]
Peter: maybe within an origin we could define it.
Travis: it could be a suggestion to the user agent to transition "in this way"

Topic: Followup on whole Doctorow / covenant stuff

Mnot: it got sent to the AC> Ab talked about it, Dan published the statement.
Travis: is our job done
Mnot: we left it that this is all we could say as the TAG
Dan: I'd agree with that.
Peter: there was talk about doing a task force
Mnot: that would be us as individuals:\.
Dan: We left it up to the AB.

Topic: Right to linking 
https://savethelink.org
http://www.w3.org/TR/publishing-linking/

Tim: various issue - one is legality, one is copyright. If you link to a priate site, can we put you in jail. The classic example was somebody who got ad revenue from a master list of places to watch free tv. That was a motivating factor for original work.
... now we have 2 motivations. One is search engines taking revnue from sites thereore search engines should pay those sites. I [don't agree] with that argument. Also sites rely in the search engine. Also people don't want deep linking - want you to come in
... theough their entrance tunnel. That sort of died.
Dan: some sites curating...
Tim: in [e.g. google] infoboxes sometimes they don't reference sources... e.g. "what's the age of this person" and they give you a short summary which is the age.
... So I gather there is a European push in that direction. The TAG felt that if you embed content from someone's site then they ought to be paying you but if you just link to them then no. If lawyers say you have to request permission to link then no.
... if you go down that road everything stops.
Dan: Maybe I should ask wendy about it?
Tim: Yes a good idea. TAG attempting to give people language to distinguish between embedded and linked content ...
Dan: FrEeeeDOM!!
Tim: http://www.w3.org/DesignIssues/LinkLaw
Tim:  http://www.w3.org/DesignIssues/LinkMyths.html
http://www.w3.org/DesignIssues/LinkLaw.html
Dan: Also http://www.w3.org/2001/tag/doc/deeplinking.html
Tim: it would create a huge ammount of friction if this idea that you have to ask permission to link to someone [takes hold].
Mnot: wondering how the embedding works - if they are using heuristics then that's one thing but if a publisher publishes metadata then that shows intent to allow republishing.
Tim: if you drop a link into skype or a social media it produces a little summary. 
Travis: a microformat.
Mnot: a bunch of pseudo-standards - e.g. twitter card. Also the schema.org stuff.
Tim: WOuld be interesting to see a document pointing to them all... Any blog?
http://microformats.org/ 
Dan: might be one for hadley since she's working on the data on the web working group.

ACTION: Dan to talk to Wendy & Hadley.

IETF Thing

Mnot: we've talked about special domain names and .onion. IETF has approved .onion. In the Yokohama meeting there was the start of a discussion - what to do with other special use domain names. 
... there is a pretty strong push to shut that down - to not have other special use domains. Long term if we decide we need another special tld...

Keygen

Travis: thanks for your feedback mark - I am ready to publish it in the repo.
Mnot: one of my feedback points was we need to show our work
Travis: I feel I have explained that more - was improved over the one you reviewed
Dan: I'm happy with it.
Travis: I'm positioning it as the start of a conversation. Not the final word of the TAG.
