The linking EU Legisltation thing.
https://savethelink.org/

Hadley: we shouldn't be in a position of lobbying... If we've already made the statement (http://www.w3.org/TR/publishing-linking/) then maybe individually we should be pushing that.
Dan: Happy to drop it.
Alex: I'd like for us to have customers. Who is asking for it?

Web Annotations 
Mark: I went through the spec - overall looks reasonable. They make some common mistakes. They use 2119 must and should too literally. They profile http in a few ways. I will put link here:
... https://github.com/w3ctag/spec-reviews/issues/93#issuecomment-156889627
... I just need to write up the comments.
Alex: can someone give an overview of why and who the clients are?
Mark: They want to be able to annotate web pages using a third party server. A group of people annotating a web page marking up parts of it and sharing those annotations.
Dan: Who are the implementors?
Tim: Annotation of third party web servers - people have been requesting it for decades. Mark Andresen put it into Netscape - an annotation server - didn't scale well. There has been questions behind it
... which protocol do you use, and how do we set our browsers to the same annotation service - so finding the annotation server. How do you find it how do you configure your system to use it? That's been more of a challenge.
Alex: slightlyoff : so this is a social protocol with no identity or spam provisions if I'm reading this right
[8:16pm] slightlyoff: and the sync model is unclear
[8:16pm] slightlyoff: what am I missing?
Dan: Implementation work going on in Mozilla?
David: I don't know of any.
Alex: I'd like to understand if it's been tested - extensions seem like a straightforward way ti implement. I'd like to know if there are folks that are implementing.
Hadley: looks like one of the uses would be a more federated approach to google apps.
Alex: Yes you could think this could be a good way to federate comment system. Google apps have complex & complicated access control system which hinges on the notion of unified identity. You have to have a ... 
...notion of ownership and disposition of comments...
Hadley: ther'es not enough here for [ e.g.] google apps to think about implenenting it.
Alex: you can use google apps offline and when you do that you can add annotations and comments. 
...in this spec are you only allowed to comment on a document?
Tim: When you use annotation server - we could use it in the TAG - some of the properties would be the same as the etherpad. the pad is like an annotation server on an emtpy document. you want to know who is contributing. you want to have security. in some cases you want to have reliabilty and security. In other cases you want to open it up to anyone inetrested in joining in. Yes it could be a target of spam if annotation services are very well known. Have we seen pad spam? The same things apply.
Hadley: could we solve this problem by asking editors to include non-normative comments on authentication and identity.
Alex: I want to understand the end-to-end. What are the situations where this accomplishes an end-to-end user goal?
Tim: use cases? e.g. w3c provides an annotation server for each working group. They publish something on a static web server and publish the annotation server people can use when they want to annotate that draft. The discovery of the annotation server in that case comes from the document itself. In case 2 the TAG is discussing an IETF document we don't have access to, We decide and share amongst ourselves the URL of the annotation server to collaborate.
Alex: current [demo] is integrated. Using hypothiesis annotator. Does this this use the protocol?
Tim: I think so - I think they are eating their own dogfood.
Alex: Some features I don't see support for in the spec.  Highlighting sections of the document.
... the protocol might be useful without addressing.
[some discussion on relation to emerging CSS work on text ranges]
Tim: for an annotation people feel they need to draw a line [selection] from any caret point to another caret point.
...when you look at the TAG reviewing a draft, the comments are in a particular version of the draft - you may want them to stick around for different editorial revisions but it's a different conversaiton when a new draft comes out. So you don't have to have a source code control granularity.
David: On the flip side if someone has inserted a section above it you want the annotation to still make sense.
Tim: Yes - the people who do this would put IDs on every heading and every paragraph - makes it more robust.
Alex: It looks like people are implementing stuff â€“ I'd like to understand if they are implementing this specifically. How do the pieces fit together?
Dan: bump this to next week and get someone on the line?
Tim: it's reasonable to look at the technology and the other thing is the marketing and motiviation. Will this be a must that will end up in every browser? Who will be motivated to run the servers, etc.. Looks like a valuable technology. We need to undestand how it's going to take off.

Security Questionnaire
Yves: It's on my plate. I am going to do it Soon.
https://github.com/w3ctag/spec-reviews/issues/77
Dan: let's talk about ti next week and hopefully get it out there.
