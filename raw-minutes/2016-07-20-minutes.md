IndexDB

Travis: in webidl - frozenarray is in use...
Tim: ?
Travis: in an indexdb implementation, it can either spend some time filling out a structure, packaging into an array like thing - or it can reutn an object that figures out the values of the array dynamically. We have both kinds of things in web platform today...
... html collections and query selector ...
Tim: one of them is basiclaly streaming... for a very large nunber you need to use iterator...
Travis: yes if there are 100k+ things then pre-iterating and populating an array is not [efficient].
... for indedb you don't know the typical load.
Alex TC39 async iterator proposal - not sure where that stands...
... champion was kevin Smith.
Travis: super urgent?
Alex: we need to give them an answer... maybe they can come up with aversion that returns an async iterator in the future?
